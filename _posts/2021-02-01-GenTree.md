title: H2020 GENTREE | Truly collaborative work
summary: Our three data papers are witnesses of a true European collaboration - with more than 100 co-authors each.

# News
The GenTree Platform: growth traits and tree-level environmental data in 12 European forest tree species, The GenTree Leaf Collection: Inter‐and intraspecific leaf variation in seven forest tree species in Europe, and The GenTree Dendroecological Collection, tree-ring and wood density data from seven tree species across Europe.  
"featured-img: collaboration" present the results of our data collection campaign. All data is open access and will hopefully facilitate many analyses to come. Right now we are working on the first association genomic analyses with this data.

# Background
[GenTree](http://www.gentree-h2020.eu/) is a H2020 funded collaborative research project that started in 2016. The goal of GenTree is to provide the European forestry sector with better knowledge, methods and tools for optimising the management and sustainable use of forest genetic resources (FGR) in Europe in the context of climate change and continuously evolving demands for forest products and services. 
My group is mostly involved in workpackages 1, 3 and 4 - so dealing with the genomic and phenotypic analyses of in total 12 important forest tree species. Most of all we are interested in Beech, Oak, Poplar, Spruce and Silver Fir.
